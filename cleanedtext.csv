space next to it of swimming pool area the menu of the breakfast was not so many but complete one the most i like about the restaurant is the taste of its food especially sambal and nasi goreng fried rice the nasi goreng and sambal really delicious and also not to forget its fried noodle the swimming pool was not so big with depth of m but it was good enough and surrounded by green tree and plant and nice flower the hotel has gym area on the second floor which although not so big but has enough equipments and treadmill completed with toilets with clean arrangement the parking lot was small

178,grandkemang Jakarta,Leon Leon,1.0,on th dec i reserved one room in grandkemang on new years eve using agoda on st dec my daughter y o and i arrived at p m at the hotel we came from town outside jakarta we then went to the reception to do the check in but i was so frustrated to learn from the receptionist william that he could not find my reservation this problem was so unbelievable i had received the confirmation from agoda and it has been paid in full then i asked him to check again with agoda he said the fault is in agoda that agoda has not confirmed the room to them or paid them i dont know if this was the real problem since it was in their reservation system however as the customer i never expected this kind of thing to happen particularly since i already paid in full and it was new years eve it would be hard to find another hotel not to mention traffic in jakarta would be so crowded on that night for my daughter and me to wander around and find an available hotel my daughter and i stood in front of the receptions for about hour nobody offered us to sit and find the solution they also let other persons queued behind us unbelieve they could add another check in counter or at least ask them to sit while they resolve my issue i still cant believe how they treat the customer since i didnt find any solutions offered by the receptions i asked to talk to the manager then the manager finally offered my daughter and me to sit he again emphasized that this was agodas fault and had nothing to do with them i asked him if he could help me find another hotel and he said i needed to wait for the agodas pic to contact me is it that difficult grand kemang could you just help a mom and a daughter to find a place to stay if you help me do so i will consider paying on my account for the new hotel but you did not the manager also said that the only help he could offer was to contact agoda related to this issue then the agoda team would contact me however i did not receive any phone or email until around p m it was also when i finally decided to leave the hotel as my daughter was already tired of waiting for something uncertain then finally agoda emails came at p m offering the refund and finding another accommodation but i think it was too late i was already tired of the lousy service from both of them i will never reserve any room from agoda and grand kemang and for grand kemang if you think agoda is a bad travel agent as per your suggestion in our discussion why would you still collaborate with them you would disappoint your next customer or maybe the customer is in that priority for you in the end i just want to say thank you to agoda and grandkemang for making the worst new years eve for my daughter and me,Negatif,on th dec i reserved one
